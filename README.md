Goals
Demonstrate proficiency in docker, python and web-services

Description
Need to write a Python REST-API service which returns the hourly price of an Amazon AWS instance given the parameters instance size and region.

The pricing information is linked below.

The submission should be committed to a publicly accessible github repository and should contain the following items:
- Dockerfile with which the service can be build and run
- README.md documentation using markdown
- python code including:
   - logging
   - unit tests
   - integration tests
